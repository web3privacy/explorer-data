description: >-
  ZKForge is a Web3 privacy ecosystem built to let users communicate, transact,
  and compute without exposing their data or identity. It brings together two
  advanced cryptographic technologies , zkSTARK proofs and Fully Homomorphic
  Encryption (FHE) to enable:

  -Encrypted messaging that’s quantum-resistant and blockchain-verified.


  -dApps that operate on encrypted data end-to-end (so user data never gets
  revealed).


  -Anonymous payments and micropayments between humans, apps, and AI agents via
  the “x402” protocol layer.


  Its goal is to provide a privacy-by-design, anonymous-by-default
  infrastructure layer for Web3: enabling private chats, confidential DeFi,
  secure gaming, anonymous identity verification, private DAO governance, and
  machine-to-machine payments among AI agents.
