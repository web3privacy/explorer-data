description: >-
  CipherNet is a privacy network that wraps every action inside an ephemeral
  identity.


  You can mix funds, send privately, test dApps, simulate flows and communicate
  without exposing your real wallet. Every session begins with a clean identity
  and ends in a complete wipe. Nothing can be reconstructed.
