  Hinkal is building infrastructure for invisible transactions that consists
  of: 

  1) Invisible wallet  — enables any on-chain activity without exposing wallet
  data and the history of transactions. 


  2) dApp - a proxy for any wallet, enabling invisible transactions without
  changing wallets.


  3) SDK for private payments. Integrated with Request Network and other
  solutions. 


  Hinkal has become the leader in the category with >$250m in transactions in
  2024. 


  Incubated at Stanford and Binance MVB, Hinkal has raised $5.7M from Draper
  Associates, Stanford, SALT, Re7, and SNZ. In 2024, it became the largest
  privacy infrastructure, achieving $250M in transaction volume.
