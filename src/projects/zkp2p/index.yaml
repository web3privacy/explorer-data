description: >-
  ZKP2P is a peer-to-peer, non-custodial on/offramp protocol built on privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs.
  Using cryptographic proofs of transfer, ZKP2P allows buyers to authenticate that they have transferred the correct value to sellers. 
  This enables a new buying and selling crypto experience that is fast, cheap and composable with DeFi.
