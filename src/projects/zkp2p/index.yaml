description: >-
  ZKP2P is the first trustless P2P on/offramping bulletin board. This enables a
  new buying and selling crypto experience that is fast, cheap and composable
  with DeFi.


  Using cryptographic proofs of transfer, ZKP2P allows buyers to authenticate
  that they have transferred the correct value to sellers.
