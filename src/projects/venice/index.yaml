description: >-
  Venice.ai is a private, censorship-resistant generative AI platform for text
  conversations, image and code generation, and AI Character interaction, built
  on open-source models and powered by decentralized infrastructure. 


  The Venice token (VVV) is designed to minimize friction and reduce costs for
  AI agents and developers to access private, reliable, on-demand and perpetual
  AI inference via Venice.ai's API. Users who stake VVV are eligible to receive
  an ongoing share of Venice.ai's inference capacity through the Venice API. VVV
  allows autonomous agents and developers to access private, uncensored and
  decentralized inference, without relying on a human intermediary, which
  reduces costs and friction for both AI agents and developers, untethering them
  from the bias and censorship inherent within closed-source incumbent AI
  platforms.
