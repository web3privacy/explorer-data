description: "Sunscreen is a cryptography R&D lab turning frontier privacy
  technology research into production-ready tooling and infrastructure. Their
  foundational technology is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a post-quantum
  secure cryptography technique which allows them to perform arbitrary
  computations directly on encrypted data. "
