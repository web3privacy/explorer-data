description: Mirage is an EVM-focused privacy solution that enables users to
  transact with stablecoins using on-chain privacy, without revealing that
  they're using a privacy system. Unlike traditional privacy tools that leave
  detectable traces on-chain, Mirage aims to make private transactions
  indistinguishable from regular ones, addressing a key limitation of existing
  solutions.
