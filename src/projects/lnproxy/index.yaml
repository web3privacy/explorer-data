description: lnproxy is a simple privacy tool that makes invoices more private.
  Users of custodial Lightning wallets get better payment destination privacy
  and sovereign node runners with enhanced receiver privacy. lnproxy works like
  a "Poor man's rendez-vous", providing privacy for users without taking custody
  of their funds.
