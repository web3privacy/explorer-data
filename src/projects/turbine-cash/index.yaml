description: >-
  A yield bearing privacy protocol on Solana.

  We built a mixer with support of LST tokens, thus solving the paradox of
  privacy vs. yield most mixers have.

  With our service, you don't need to choose, you can let your funds sit at the
  mixer for a long time, since they're still earning.
