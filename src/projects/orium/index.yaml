description: >-
  ORIUM is a privacy-first Layer 1 blockchain designed as digital cash. In a
  world where payments are monitored by default, ORIUM makes transactions
  private by design, ensuring that identities, balances, and transaction
  relationships are not exposed on public ledgers. Privacy is enforced through
  cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, not through trust, policy, or
  intermediaries.

  ORIUM separates spending, reading, and proving into independent capabilities,
  giving users full control over disclosure. It operates as a neutral protocol,
  not an organization, restoring the core properties of money: fungibility,
  neutrality, and sovereignty. It can be used as an everyday payment method,
  with features like pay link and cash link, only on ORIUM.
