  Fiber Network Node (FNN) is a reference node implementation of Fiber Network
  Protocol (FNP). Fiber network is a peer-to-peer payment/swap network (like
  Lightning Network). We believe payment and swap are the two foundational
  primitives of finance.


  Features

      Multiple assets support, e.g. stable coins, RGB++ assets issued on Bitcoin ledger, and UDT assets issued on CKB ledger;
      Extremely low-cost micropayments, e.g. 0.0001 cent payment with 0.00000001 cent fee;
      Instant swap between any asset pairs, as long as there's available channel paths;
      Cross-network asset payment/swap, e.g. from Lightning network to Fiber network, and vice versa;
      Watchtower support, make it easier for node operators;
      Multi-hop payment, anyone can facilitate payments and earn payment fees by running a fiber node and becoming a hop on payment paths;
      Low latency, e.g. 0.0001 cent payment in your p2p connection latency, e.g. 20ms;
      High throughput, because transactions are only processed by involved peers, no network consensus required;
      High privacy, your transactions are only seen by involved peers;
      Based on more advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure security and privacy, e.g. uses PTLC not HTLC;
      Composable with other contracts/scripts on CKB;
