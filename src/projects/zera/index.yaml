description: >-
  The ZERA Protocol is a universal, direct-deposit privacy layer for the assets
  you already hold. It's token and chain-agnostic: bring existing tokens (e.g.,
  USDC, USDT, SOL and more) into a single, unified cryptographic pool to receive
  shielded balances with private transfers—including offline, device-to-device
  payments that sync to chain later.


  No synthetic pegs, no mixers, no bridging - just a composable privacy layer
  designed for real usage.
