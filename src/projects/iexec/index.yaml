  iExec is a Web3 platform for developers to build decentralized applications
  that empower users with control over their data ownership, privacy, and
  monetization.



  Building with iExec means offering users applications where privacy comes
  first. Users control what data they share and how they use their digital
  assets, with the ability to securely monetize them through iExec's native RLC
  tokens.



  iExec developer tools make it seamless to integrate features like encrypted
  data management with DataProtector, privacy-preserving communication with
  Web3Mail, and real-world data integration using Oracle Factory. The iExec
  protocol leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to encrypt and
  protect data in use, ensuring sensitive information is processed securely.
  Blockchain acts as a governance layer, verifying the integrity of the data and
  its processing. This powerful combination ensures that no unauthorized party
  can access or tamper with data during execution, offering a robust solution
  for privacy-focused applications. With iExec, developers can create dApps that
  offer strong security, user-centric monetization, and true digital ownership
  through NFTs.
