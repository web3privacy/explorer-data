  Core Technology

  Diode uses decentralized, peer-to-peer networking technology combined with
  self-custody identity, access control, and a built-in secure networking layer
  similar to a VPN. Communication and collaboration run directly between users
  or via nodes on the Diode Network, which provide private, encrypted routing
  and always-on connectivity without centralized servers or third-party
  intermediaries.


  Special Features:

  Special features include phone-number-free accounts, end-to-end encrypted
  messaging, decentralized file sharing, private networking (VPN-like tunnels),
  and always-on access via user-controlled nodes and canisters. All access,
  identity, and data remain under user control.


  Why Use Diode: 

  Users should choose Diode if they need private, resilient collaboration that
  doesn’t rely on centralized platforms. It’s designed for teams, communities,
  organizations, and people that value security, sovereignty, and long-term
  autonomy for collaboration.
