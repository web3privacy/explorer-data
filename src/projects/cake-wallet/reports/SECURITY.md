- ‚ùì Security incident history
- ‚ùì Penetration testing results (if conducted)
- ‚ùì Bug bounty program details (if exists)

### Recommendation for Due Diligence
If security audits are critical for your evaluation:
1. **Check GitHub directly** - Review code, commits, and security history
2. **Contact project** - Email support@cakewallet.com to ask about audits
3. **Community research** - Check Reddit, Twitter, technical forums
4. **Monero perspective** - Monero community views on Cake Wallet security
5. **Comparison** - How other privacy wallets handle audits (Wasabi, Sparrow, etc.)
