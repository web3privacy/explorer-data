  Vector Privacy is an open-source ecosystem that is focused on ensuring the
  human right to privacy through encrypted communication tools. Vector Messenger
  is a decentralized communication platform built on the Nostr Protocol,
  offering no-compromise encryption with zero metadata leakage and plausible
  deniability for all content, including texts, media, voice notes, and files,
  adhering to the NIP-17 standard. It natively integrates BIP-39, allowing every
  Vector account to function as a crypto wallet and vice versa, streamlining
  tasks like address sharing and payments through compatibility with native
  wallets like MPW. Vector leverages local, private, device-powered AI to
  provide practical features such as voice message transcription, language
  translation, and meme gif search via a decentralized relay-based index. Its
  resilience is ensured by community-run Nostr relays, eliminating downtime, and
  its fully open-source codebase—from infrastructure to protocol specs—avoids
  proprietary lock-in, making it unkillable and transparent.


  Open-source technology developed by Formless Labs.

third_party_dependency: Vector does not depend on any third-parties, but
  operates entirely with an orchestrated merging of decentralized and
  open-source protocols. As Vector is entirely open-source, individuals can run
  their own versions, modify them, and do whatever they see fit and it does not
  effect the core protocol. Vector was designed to be standalone, lean,
  efficient in most circumstances, and not depend on any third parties to
  operate—a great example is AWS and CloudFlare outages that cripple all
  communication for other messenger apps, but not Vector.
social_trust: "Open-source core developers and the community are what govern the
  direction of Vector. It does not rely on a single person or entity to function
  or thrive. Due to the current stage of Vector, there is no need for a DAO-like
  structure in order to operate. As time progresses, it will adopt whatever
  methods and protocols necessary to scale with the community. "
technical_spof: There is not a known single point of failure for Vector as long
  as the vision stays alive and there is a demand for true privacy and
  censorship-resistant communication. Vector does not rely on any entity for
  funding to continue operations, but instead the love for privacy and
  contributions of the community. Vector itself is unaffected if any particular
  person is hacked or their private keys are compromised—that is a concern
  solely for that individual and the peers they have contacted. One potential,
  but unlikely point of failure is if the entire internet goes down or every
  single node on the network goes offline.
