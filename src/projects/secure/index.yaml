description: Secure is a revolutionary Android messaging application that
  combines truly serverless peer-to-peer communication, post-quantum
  cryptography, and integrated cryptocurrency payments. Unlike Signal, Session,
  or any traditional messenger, Secure eliminates ALL central infrastructure—no
  servers exist to log your metadata, no company can hand over data that was
  never collected.
