  Fast. Private. Real-World Ready.


  Overview

  Telos is a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain built for real-world adoption -
  uniting high speed, scalability, and a privacy-first design in one powerful
  network. Its advanced WASM-based architecture powers the Telos EVM, an
  Ethereum-compatible environment delivering sub-second finality, zero
  front-running, and a frictionless developer experience.


  The  Privacy Layer extends the EVM with integrated zero-knowledge technology -
  enabling shielded transactions, confidential dApps, and cross-token privacy
  directly within the ecosystem. For the first time, privacy will be a built-in
  feature of the EVM itself, not an add-on.
