  Darklake is a privacy-first DEX using ZK proofs to prevent MEV before it
  starts.


  Darklakeâ€™s zkAMM encrypts trade size, direction, and slippage to ensure trader
  intent remains private. This prevents malicious actors from extracting value
  through front-running, sandwiching, or other forms of MEV.


  Unlike other systems that mitigate the negative effects of MEV through
  retroactive protection or L2 wrappers, Darklake builds native defense directly
  into its execution logic with built-in encryption at the protocol level.
