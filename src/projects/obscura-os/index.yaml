description: >-
  Obscura OS is a lightweight on-chain operating system designed to bring
  privacy, clarity, and structured control to Solana users.

  Instead of interacting with scattered tools, unsafe dApps, or untrusted
  scanners, Obscura OS consolidates everything into a single secure environment
  from analysis to execution.
