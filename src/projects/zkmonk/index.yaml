  Our end goal is to see a world where digital privacy / privacy on transaction
  on internet is by default. We believe the only way possible is if there are
  more innovation in implementation of privacy tech. 

  More innovation can happen when more bright minds/engineers work on this. 


  We try to make more ground level impact to onboard developers to Web3/ZK and
  other implementation of cryptographic primitives by providing opportunities to
  learn, collaborate and work on these technologies.
