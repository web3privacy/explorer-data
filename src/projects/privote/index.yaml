  Create polls, participate in elections, and make your voice heard in a Private
  and Decentralized way.


  Privote is a decentralized voting mechanism that allows users to vote on-chain
  in a private and secure manner. It uses Maci protocol made by PSE team to
  ensure that votes don't leak and are not tampered with. The project is
  open-source and anyone can contribute to it. Privote enables users to create
  various types of private polls and vote on them. It also provides various
  types of auth mechanisms like Anon-Aadhar (aadhar based verification from
  India), WorldCoin-auth, NFC (can be used in IRL events like ethglobal
  hackathons), etc, enabling holding of various interesting polls without
  revealing the choice of voters.
