description: "ZisK is a high-performance zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine)
  designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs of arbitrary program execution. It
  enables developers to prove the correctness of a computation without revealing
  its internal state, making ZisK a powerful tool for privacy-preserving and
  verifiable computation. "
