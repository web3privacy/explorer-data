  The ultimate dark builder's toolkit and privacy infrastructure for the
  sovereign individual. 
    
    Beyond a non-custodial aggregator, 
    it provides a full suite of cryptographic utilities: 
    
    1. Finance: No-KYC Swaps, Ghost Protocol (Anonymizer), and a 'Ghost Market' to buy Prepaid Visa/Gift Cards with Monero.
    2. Communication: 'PGP+Nostr Terminal' for zero-knowledge encrypted chat and 'Ghost Mail' for lightning-paid burner emails.
    3. Cryptography: Client-side tools including Shamir's Secret Sharing, Dead Drops (ZK secret sharing), and raw transaction broadcasting.
    
    Zero logs. Client-side encryption. Total financial sovereignty.
