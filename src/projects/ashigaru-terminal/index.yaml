description: >-
  Ashigaru Terminal is an implementation of Samourai Walletâ€™s Whirlpool, which
  enables users to voluntarily participate in Zerolink coinjoins once again to
  achieve forward and backwards privacy for their Bitcoin transactions. 


  Clients that connect to a coordinator running this protocol are able to break
  all deterministic links with 100% entropy between inputs and outputs.
