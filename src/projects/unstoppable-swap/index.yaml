description: >-
  Exchange Bitcoin for Monero peer-to-peer, trustlessly, securely, without risk,
  reliably, and freely.

  Powered by atomic swaps. Zero trust required. No middlemen. Pure peer-to-peer
  exchange through the Tor network. Complete privacy. Built by the community,
  for everyone


  UnstoppableSwap is a protocol and desktop application. When you run the app,
  you can connect to and swap with different makers. Makers are users who run
  the UnstoppableSwap protocol on their own computer or server to provide
  liquidity. They buy your Bitcoin and in return give you Monero. Each maker can
  set their own prices and fees.
