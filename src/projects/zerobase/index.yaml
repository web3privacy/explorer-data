description: >-
  ZEROBASE is a high-performance, decentralized zero-knowledge (ZK) proving
  network built for real-time computation, regulatory compliance, and
  large-scale commercial use. It is designed to address the core trust gaps in
  global finance, where trillions of dollars move daily through systems that
  remain fragmented, inefficient, and opaque.


  ZEROBASE supports a broad range of ZK applications, including zkLogin,
  zkDarkPool, zkVote, and zkCEX, and offers both standard and custom circuit
  development. With free integration, custom circuits delivered in 2â€“3 weeks,
  and compatibility with Circom, Gnark, and an optional decryptable circuit
  layer, ZEROBASE supports agile development across both Web3 and enterprise
  sectors.
