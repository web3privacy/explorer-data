social_trust: >-
  Silensio is currently governed by a core team using a multisig wallet for key
  operations and contract management.

  In the future, governance will gradually transition to a DAO structure,
  allowing the community to vote on upgrades, fees, and ecosystem decisions
  using the $SILEN token.
technical_spof: >-
  Silensio is built fully onchain and doesn’t store user data, so there’s
  nothing to leak.

  A shutdown or exploit would require a critical smart contract vulnerability or
  compromise of the multisig wallet managing upgrades.

  We don’t use centralized servers, and there are no admin backdoors.
