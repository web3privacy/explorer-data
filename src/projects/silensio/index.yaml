description: Silensio is a modular, zero-knowledge-native privacy infrastructure
  built for Web3. It enables programmable privacy across asset transfers,
  identity, and communicationâ€”empowering users to interact onchain without
  exposing sensitive data. Designed to be chain-agnostic and fully auditable,
  Silensio brings privacy by default to the decentralized internet.
