  The ultimate dark builder's toolkit and privacy infrastructure for the sovereign individual. 
  
  Beyond a non-custodial aggregator, 
  it provides a full suite of cryptographic utilities: 
  
  1. Finance: No-KYC Swaps, Ghost Protocol (Anonymizer), and a 'Ghost Market' to buy Prepaid Visa/Gift Cards with Monero.
  2. Communication: 'PGP+Nostr Terminal' for zero-knowledge encrypted chat and 'Ghost Mail' for lightning-paid burner emails.
  3. Cryptography: Client-side tools including Shamir's Secret Sharing, Dead Drops (ZK secret sharing), and raw transaction broadcasting.
  
  Zero logs. Client-side encryption. Total financial sovereignty.
