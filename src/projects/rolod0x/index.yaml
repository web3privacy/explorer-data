  rolod0x is a free privacy-preserving address book which gives you a much
  smoother experience when browsing sites onchain.


  Instead of having to keep track of long hexadecimal addresses, simply
  right-click an address and give it a memorable label.  Now when you go to any
  web page, the extension automatically replaces that address wherever it
  appears with the label you provided.  This makes understanding onchain
  activity way easier, and it works on any website and any blockchain.


  You can also quickly look up any address by pressing a hotkey, and then just
  type part of what you're looking for.

third_party_dependency: It is dependent on various npm modules which are listed
  in the package.json file.
social_trust: It's an open source browser extension, so has the same trust
  assumptions as using any other open source browser extension, i.e. that the
  code does not contain malware, and if installing from an app store or
  precompiled release that it has been built from the published sources.
technical_spof: There is no single point of failure.  Anyone can fork the
  repository and build it themselves.
