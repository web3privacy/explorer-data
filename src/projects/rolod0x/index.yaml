  rolod0x is a free privacy-preserving address book which gives you a much
  smoother experience when browsing sites onchain.


  Instead of having to keep track of long hexadecimal addresses, simply
  right-click an address and give it a memorable label.  Now when you go to any
  web page, the extension automatically replaces that address wherever it
  appears with the label you provided.  This makes understanding onchain
  activity way easier, and it works on any website and any blockchain.


  You can also quickly look up any address by pressing a hotkey, and then just
  type part of what you're looking for.
