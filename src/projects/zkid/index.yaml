  zkID is a strategic initiative of the Ethereum Foundation, in collaboration
  with Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE), focused on advancing the use of
  Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in digital identity systems. We contribute to PSE
  by leading research, coordination, education, and development efforts that
  enable privacy-preserving, interoperable, and standards-aligned identity
  infrastructure.


  Our team works and distributes grants across the identity ecosystem to draft
  technical standards, maintain open-source resources, and prototype
  infrastructure that aligns with evolving regulatory frameworks. By stewarding
  collaboration between researchers, developers, governments, and institutions,
  zkID bridges foundational cryptographic research with real-world deployment
  and impact.
