description: >
  Dex223 is the first decentralized exchange that supports ERC-20 and ERC-223
  token standards. ERC-223 token standard solves a design problem of ERC-20
  which makes error handling impossible and resulted in a loss of $100,000,000
  worth of tokens on Ethereum chain. ERC-223 standard eliminates "approvals"
  from a token workflow. Dex223 intends to drive the adoption of ERC-223 by
  "blending" it with existing tokens through wrappers approach: an integral part
  of the project is a Token Converter which creates exactly one ERC-223 version
  for each existing ERC-20 token ensuring an opportunity to transition from one
  standard to another.
