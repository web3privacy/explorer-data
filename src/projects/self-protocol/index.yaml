description: >
  Self is an identity wallet that lets users generate privacy-preserving proofs
  from government-issued IDs such as passports. By scanning the NFC chip in
  their ID document, users can prove their validity while only revealing
  specific attributes such as age, nationality or simply humanity. Under the
  hood, Self uses zk-SNARKs to make sure personal data is redacted, but the
  document is verified.


  Use cases unlocked include:

    - Airdrop protection: Protect a token distribution from bots
    - Social media: Add humanity checks to user's profiles
    - Quadratic funding: Prevent farmers from skewing rewards
    - Wallet recovery: Safeguard assets using IDs as recovery sources
    - Compliance: Check a user is not part of a sanctioned entity list
