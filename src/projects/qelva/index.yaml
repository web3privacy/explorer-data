description: >-
  Qelva is a privacy-native identity and transaction layer built for Solana. It
  introduces a seedless, multi-persona identity system combined with an
  intent-based execution model to eliminate the exposure of a user’s real wallet
  on-chain.

  All cryptographic keys are generated and stored locally, while the
  architecture separates identity, intent, and execution to ensure strong
  metadata minimization.


  Qelva uses a relayer-based private execution pipeline, where user intents are
  validated off-chain and executed on-chain by a relayer, breaking the direct
  link between users and their transactions. The system incorporates Split &
  Delay obfuscation, persona-scoped wallets, and non-custodial authentication
  (username + PIN) to provide lightweight but practical privacy for everyday
  Solana usage.


  Qelva is designed for users and developers who want private transfers, persona
  separation, on-chain activity obfuscation, and a secure identity layer without
  seed phrase exposure or centralized trust. It serves as a foundation for
  privacy-preserving wallets, dApps, and automated systems on Solana.

  data_usage: Used only for realtime request processing. No storage, no analytics,

    on-device.

third_party_dependency: >
  Minimal third-party dependency. Qelva relies only on Solana RPC providers for
  on-chain execution. 

  All identity, keys, and user logic run fully client-side with no reliance on
  custodial or centralized services.
social_trust: >
  No treasury or admin key exposure. Qelva uses a non-custodial model where
  users control their own keys. 

  Backend infrastructure is stateless and performs no sensitive operations. No
  multisig or privileged wallet required.
technical_spof: >
  Failure of Solana RPC infrastructure may temporarily affect relayer
  execution. 

  No user keys or identities are at risk because all encryption and signing
  occur locally on the device.
