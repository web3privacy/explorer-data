  token swaps on Solana. Using zero-knowledge cryptography and decentralized
  relay networks, Anovex breaks the transaction graph between user wallets and
  on-chain activity.

  wallet

  • ZK Relay Network for anonymous fund routing

  • No KYC, no registration, no email required

  • Private key never leaves your device

  • Non-custodial architecture


  Technology:

  • Jupiter Aggregator integration for best swap rates

  • Real-time portfolio tracking with encrypted storage

  • Telegram bot for private trading

  • NFC Card Wallet support for instant access


  Anovex ensures your trading activity remains completely private - protecting
  you from surveillance, front-running, and wallet profiling.
