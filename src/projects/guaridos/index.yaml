  data_usage: GuaridOS collects limited and anonymized usage data for the sole
    purpose of improving performance, security, and overall reliability of the
    platform. Collected metrics include system errors, latency, and aggregate
    feature usage patterns. We do not collect or analyze user content (such as
    emails, files, or messages). All sensitive information remains encrypted
    client-side and inaccessible to our monitoring systems. Usage data is
    handled responsibly, stored in aggregated form, and may be published in
    transparency or audit reports to ensure accountability to the community.

  tracked_data: GuaridOS collects the bare minimum (email/wallet for identity,
    encrypted payloads for communication & storage) and does not resell or
    misuse any user data.

third_party_dependency: GuaridOS has limited third-party dependencies. The core
  modules (Mail, Drive, Vault, VPN, Authenticator) run on Flux’s decentralized
  compute and storage network, reducing reliance on centralized providers. We do
  not depend on oracles like Chainlink, nor on Uniswap liquidity pools. External
  dependencies are limited to standard blockchain infrastructure
  (Ethereum/Solana RPC endpoints) and Flux nodes as our main backbone.
social_trust: The project is governed through a multisig wallet controlled by
  core contributors, with a roadmap to progressively hand governance to a DAO.
  Treasury management and security decisions are not dependent on a single
  individual; instead, funds require multiple signers, reducing social trust
  risk.
technical_spof: >-
  GuaridOS doesn’t rely on one central server, so if a single node goes down,
  the system keeps running thanks to Flux’s decentralized network. That said,
  there are still a few extreme cases that could cause bigger issues — like a
  major cryptography break, the multisig keys all getting compromised at once,
  or the Flux network itself going offline.

  Outside of those rare scenarios, most of the stack is built to stay resilient
  even if individual parts fail.
