description: >-
  WaveTek is a private DeFi app on Solana for encrypted swaps, quantum-secure
  bridging, and confidential staking.


  As on-chain finance scales, surveillance scales faster. What began as radical
  transparency has evolved into permanent financial exposure — where wallets are
  tracked, strategies are copied, and capital behavior is indexed and extracted.


  WaveTek exists to neutralize that reality. It enables private participation,
  aligned incentives, and encrypted capital flow on Solana without sacrificing
  speed, composability, or user experience.


  WaveSwap enables private swaps using Encifher, confidentially routed through
  Jupiter — protecting users from on-chain surveillance and strategy leakage.



  WavePortal bridges assets to Zcash for shielding or Starknet for ZK and
  post-quantum security — preparing capital for the next threat vector.



  WaveStake enables confidential staking for aligned, long-term participation.
  Users stake $WAVE, earn $WEALTH, and receive protocol revenue share. Ten
  percent of the $WEALTH supply is allocated to staking rewards for the
  community.
