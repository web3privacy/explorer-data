description: >-
  We use client-side encryption, private Solana routing, and a decentralized
  identity system so every action and every piece of data stays fully in the
  user’s control. All information is processed locally, never stored on
  centralized servers, and cannot be accessed by anyone except the user.

  Zynexa is a privacy-first operating system for Web3, offering encrypted tools,
  wallet-based login, and more private on-chain interactions. Users choose
  Zynexa because it gives them complete control over their identity,
  communication, and data in the simplest and most secure way.

  encryption: We use a combination of modern cryptography and privacy
    technologies, including Ed25519 (Curve25519) for secure signatures, BIP-39
    mnemonic wallets, and NaCl Box (Curve25519) end-to-end encryption to protect
    user data. Our communication layer is secured using X3DH key exchange and
    the Double Ratchet Protocol, ensuring forward secrecy and private messaging.
    For on-chain privacy and identity abstraction, we integrate ZK-SNARKs,
    allowing users to verify actions without revealing sensitive information.
    Together, these technologies create a fully private environment where
    identity, messages, and interactions remain secure and unlinkable.

  data_usage: We do not use or resell any user information. No tracking, no
    analytics, no data gathering. All sensitive data stays on the user’s device,
    and nothing is stored or processed on our servers.

  tracked_data: We do not collect personal data such as IP addresses, location,
    e-mail, or identifiers. All encryption keys and sensitive information stay
    on the user’s device. The only thing the system interacts with is the user’s
    wallet address, strictly for authentication — and even that is not stored or
    linked to any activity. In short, we collect no personal data, store nothing
    on servers, and everything remains fully client-side and private
