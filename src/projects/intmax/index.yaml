description: >-
  INTMAX is an scalable layer for Ethereum transfers that incorporates ethically
  sound privacy. It is a stateless zkRollup structure, theoretically achieving
  scalability similar to Plasma and Lightning Network, as envisioned in 2018. By
  distributing both data and computation costs across usersâ€™ devices, INTMAX
  inherits security from Ethereum while achieving scalability even greater than
  centralized financial systems using databases.


  INTMAX Wallet stands out by eliminating the need for downloading additional
  extensions and writing down lengthy recovery phrases. It offers a smooth user
  experience with passkey authentication and top-tier security through
  Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
