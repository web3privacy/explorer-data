  Encifher is a privacy engine for DeFi apps. It's like a plug-and-play modular
  middleware that empowers DeFi apps with seamless, compliant privacy.


  One way is integrating directly with existing dApps and their liquidity,
  Encifher ensures users donâ€™t need to change ecosystems, download additional
  wallets, or compromise on functionality. Another way is new dApps can
  integrate in their smart contracts with private states.


  In the core, Encifher uses these off-chain Privacy Enhancing Technology
  Co-processors, which allow the state to be represented in the smart contract
  as encrypted.
