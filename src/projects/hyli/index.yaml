  Hyli is the new proof-powered L1 to build the next generation of apps.


  With Hyli, developers can build fast, composable, and verifiable apps without
  dealing with the usual pains of blockchain.


  On Hyli, instead of executing transactions onchain, you run your app logic
  anywhere off-chain, in Rust, Noir, or even multiple languages at once. You
  only need to send a proof for onchain settlement. With this model, your app
  benefits from the Web2 user experience and the security of Web3.

third_party_dependency: Each app settling on Hyli will have its own
  dependencies. We support a variety of proving schemes, so each contract will
  have these dependencies as well.
social_trust: We currently do not have liquidity (testnet phase). Governance is
  currently done through the company itself.
technical_spof: The point of failure depends on the choices made by each
  application running on Hyli. Proving scheme vulnerabilities would make
  applications using them vulnerable at the app level. Consensus is
  BFT-resistant.
