  Openbands is an anonymous and verified employee forum. Users can sign in with
  their work email and prove their company affiliation while preserving their
  identiy.


  After signing up users can participate in anonymous conversations.


  We are using Noir zkJWT library to prove a user is authorized to log into a
  company email. The user generated the proof client-side and submits it
  onchain, where it's verified and stored.


  Our aim to build a global community powered by truth and ran by professionals.

  In a future version, we want companies to post job listings. The fees
  collected for posting a job will be distributed to active contributors.
