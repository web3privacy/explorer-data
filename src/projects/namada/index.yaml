social_trust: "Namada is designed to be a decentralized and community-governed
  protocol. Consensus is formed on off-chain communication channels and ratified
  through on-chain governance proposals, which can include changes to
  parameters, protocol upgrades, treasury management, voted on directly by the
  community, using a staking-based system. Token holders are able to delegate
  their voting power to validators if they do not want to participate directly.
