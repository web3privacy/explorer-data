  Vanish enables private trading with integrity on Solana, designed for traders
  who value privacy, speed, and security.


  Onchain transparency is both a strength and a weakness: every trade is
  visible, exposing strategies to frontrunning, copy traders, and unwanted
  attention. Vanish introduces shielded execution, providing instant private
  swaps for legitimate traders while preventing misuse from bad actors.
