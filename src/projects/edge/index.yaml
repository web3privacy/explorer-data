    description: "Join us June 20–22 at MoneroKon 2025: the annual gathering of
      cypherpunks, privacy advocates, researchers, and developers working to
      push the boundaries of privacy-enhancing technologies and decentralized
      systems. Held in Prague, MoneroKon brings together the global privacy
      community to share breakthroughs, challenge assumptions, and build the
      future of financial freedom.  Edge is proud to be an official Contributor
      to this year’s event. We’ll be on-site with a booth and a special
      opportunity to win $1,000 in XMR! Stop by the Edge booth to connect with
      our team, enter the giveaway, and learn how Edge makes it easier than ever
      to securely manage Monero and other privacy-focused assets.  If you’re
      passionate about privacy, self-custody, and building real solutions for a
      freer world, we’d love to see you there."
