description: >
  AdPriva is privacy-first ad verification using cryptography and blockchain.
  Every ad engagement becomes a tamper-proof 

  cryptographic proof, verified with zero-knowledge math, and permanently
  recorded on-chain - without cookies or tracking. 


  Publishers eliminate fraud and earn more. Advertisers pay only for verified
  humans. Users get privacy, relevance, and USDC rewards. 


  We're fixing the $700B digital ad industry with cryptographic verification
  instead of surveillance.
