description: ShieldOS is a decentralized personal security operating system
  built on Solana, designed to provide a full suite of encrypted tools for
  communication, identity, storage, and browsing. Every module runs locally with
  client-side encryption and wallet-based authentication, ensuring that no user
  data is ever collected or stored on a centralized server. ShieldOS includes an
  AI-powered assistant, secure authenticator, encrypted vault, private mail
  system, IPFS-based drive, secure browser with phishing detection,
  decentralized identity (DID) manager, VPN configuration module, encrypted
  chat, and a usage-based payment layer powered by x402. The system is
  engineered for complete privacy, zero-trust interactions, and long-term
  sustainability as a modular Web3 security environment.

third_party_dependency: >
  ShieldOS operates primarily client-side and does not rely on custodial
  services, centralized APIs, or external oracle networks. Core modules function
  independently using local encryption, wallet authentication, and optional
  decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave). No dependency on liquidity pools, DEX
  contracts, or external smart contract infrastructure for core functionality.
social_trust: >
  ShieldOS is non-custodial and does not control user assets or hold user funds.
  Governance and security are handled transparently through open development on
  GitHub. All sensitive operations are client-side, and no multisig or
  team-controlled wallet has access to user data or funds.
technical_spof: >
  ShieldOS is fully non-custodial. The project does not control user assets or
  hold funds. Security and transparency are maintained through open-source
  development on GitHub. No multisig or centralized entity has access to user
  data or treasury.
