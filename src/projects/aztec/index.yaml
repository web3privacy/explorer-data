description: A privacy-first L2 on Ethereum that has a hybrid privacy model - it
  allows private execution and private state as well as public execution &
  state. Aztec also enables private interactions with Ethereum.  It uses
  zero-knowledge proofs that are generated locally on the user's machine to
  prove a legal transaction. Private state is encrypted and stored in a UTXO
  tree.
