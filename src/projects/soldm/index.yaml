third_party_dependency: >-
  solDM is built natively on Solana and depends on a small number of external
  components:


  1. Solana mainnet / RPC providers for submitting transactions and reading
  on-chain state

  2. Light Protocol for zk-compressed state (the message-state / inbox
  commitments are compressed and anchored on Solana via Light’s infrastructure).

  3. Dialect for optional wallet-native notifications (push/alerts for new
  message events without exposing plaintext)

  4. Content storage layer for ciphertext blobs (currently IPFS via Pinata in
  prototype).


  Critical note: encryption happens client-side, these dependencies don't have
  access to plaintext.
social_trust: >-
  solDM does not custody user private keys. Message encryption keys live
  client-side only.


  We will run an external security audit and publish a threat model + audit
  summary. Open-sourcing is planned to make the system verifiable by the
  community.
technical_spof: >-
  We’ve designed solDM to avoid “one server goes down → chat dies” and “one
  database leak → messages leak”, but there are still a few realistic failure
  modes to acknowledge:


  1. If a user’s device/keystore is compromised, their messages can be decrypted
  (same as any E2EE system).

  2. Individual RPCs can rate-limit, but users can switch providers, the
  protocol does not require a single RPC.
