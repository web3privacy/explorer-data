description: Enclave is an open-source protocol for Encrypted Execution
  Environments (E3s). E3s enable secure, private, and verifiable computations on
  multiple inputs of encrypted data, using programmable cryptography (FHE, ZKPs,
  and MPC) and blockchain. As a complement to or alternative for TEEs, E3s
  unlock use cases like secret voting, sealed-bid auctions, and confidential
  data pools.
