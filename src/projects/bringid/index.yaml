description: BringID is a privacy-preserving protocol for verifying humanness
  using existing Internet accounts. By aggregating verifiable credentials from
  services like Uber, GitHub, or Airbnb — without ever revealing user identities
  — BringID enables crypto applications to assess trust and reputation without
  compromising privacy. Leveraging MPC-TLS and zero-knowledge group proofs, the
  system produces unlinkable attestations and customizable trust scores. This
  approach addresses the growing need for Sybil resistance, privacy-preserving
  airdrops, and composable identity in an environment increasingly flooded with
  bots and synthetic activity.
