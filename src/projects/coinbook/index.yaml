description: CoinBookâ€™s Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Exchange allows for one party
  to list their tokens in exchange for other tokens on the CoreDAO blockchain
  powered by smart contract technology. When trading on a CEX, charts and other
  market aggregators are used to determine the optimal time to buy, sell, or
  hold cryptocurrencies. CoinBook gives you more control over who buys your
  crypto and who you buy from, such as the pricing and settlement time.
