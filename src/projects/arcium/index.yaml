description: Arcium introduces a decentralized, global supercomputer that
  revolutionizes the internet by enabling the secure execution of any
  computation on fully encrypted data. Our technology creates a paradigm shift
  in how we approach computing and trustless interactions, allowing users to
  protect everything while computing anything.

technical_spof: Breaking the information-theoretic security or collusion in our
  MPC protocols is highly unlikely. Our dishonest majority protocol, Cerberus,
  is designed to be secure against malicious adversaries, while our honest
  majority protocol, Manticore, ensures security against semi-honest
  adversaries. To further enhance defense-in-depth, we plan to integrate Trusted
  Execution Environments (TEEs) into our protocols, significantly reducing the
  already minimal chances of data leakage.
