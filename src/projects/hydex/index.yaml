description: >-
  Hydex is a non‑custodial, privacy‑preserving bridge connecting the Zcash
  Orchard shielded pool to the Solana blockchain. It enables:

      Shielded ZEC deposits → Shielded Wrapped ZEC (sZEC) on Solana

      sZEC burns → Shielded ZEC withdrawals

  Hydex ensures:

      No deposit/withdrawal linkage

      No leakage of Zcash metadata

      No requirement to reveal view keys or spending keys
