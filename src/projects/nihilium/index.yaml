  Nihilium is building the missing primitive for privacy applications:
  universal, censorship-resistant key recovery for encrypted-at-rest data. While
  encrypted apps like Signal and PGP offer mathematical privacy, they fail
  mainstream adoption because losing your key means permanently losing your
  data—no "forgot my password" option exists. Nihilium solves this through a
  unique protocol that allow users to recover access by proving they meet
  predefined conditions (email ownership, biometric proofs, timelocks), without
  relying on custodians or requiring complex coordination with friends and
  family. The system uses zkp's, homomorphic encryption with two-party
  computation combined economic incentives and on-chain enforcement to ensure
  recovery cannot be censored or denied, while keeping the burden of proof
  entirely on the recovering user. This makes privacy-preserving applications
  finally accessible to regular users without sacrificing the sovereignty that
  makes encryption meaningful—turning "technically correct but humanly
  impossible" privacy tools into practical everyday solutions.
