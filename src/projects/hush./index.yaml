  Hush is a privacy-first Solana wallet. We built it because existing wallets
  expose your entire transaction history to the world — anyone can see your
  balance, track your purchases, and follow your activity across the blockchain.


  Hush handles privacy behind the scenes. You use it like a normal wallet —
  single balance view, send to addresses directly, swap tokens normally — while
  zero-knowledge proofs and a multi-wallet architecture keep your financial
  activity confidential.
